Dear:

I am glad you are interested in the following paper. 
Xuehu Yan, Yuliang Lu, Lintao Liu, and Xianhua Song, ¡°Reversible image secret sharing,¡± IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, p. Early Access, 2020.

Attached my source code.
You need to install the following.
1.	matlab 14 or later; working folder: D:\work\SecretShare


You can use a translator to read my matlab code comments.
RSISShare.m is the main matlab file, you can begin the code from it.
All the files (including the .p files) should be in the same path.

Any questions, please contact publictiger@126.com
